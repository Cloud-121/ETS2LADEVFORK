# Version 1.11.0

We are hard at work on getting 2.0 working. You can check the discord for progress on that!

This version is once again bundled with a new installer, though this time it should actually work, and it shouldn't be flagged by most antiviruses anymore ([Check the virustotal report here!](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a7bfa80aab2dd8692e598b930a18be8caa6d1e264a13d3ab21ac2bf58630b7a4?nocache=1)). We've also added a new AI based driving mode for Navigation Detection, this will keep getting updates as we go along. Be sure to occasionally check the toggle to update the model and test it out!

As always there have been too many changes to go over here (69 updates to be exact, **nice**) so I'll just go over the major updates.

### Major Changes
- New installer
- Navigation Detection AI based model support. (and continuous updates)

	- Massive thanks to the people with crash reporting enabled, this has helped immensely in getting them fixed.

### Notes on installer
It is recommended to try and use the new .exe installer, however, if for some reason that does not work, you can still use the manual install instructions at [the wiki page](https://wiki.ets2la.com/tutorials/installation/#manual-installation).
