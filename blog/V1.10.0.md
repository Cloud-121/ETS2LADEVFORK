# Version 1.10.0

This version is also bundled with a new .exe installer. It can be found in the sourceforge download.
We also do still include the raw installer code in the [installer branch](https://github.com/Tumppi066/Euro-Truck-Simulator-2-Lane-Assist/tree/installer), for the new installer the code can be found [on it's repo](https://github.com/Tumppi066/Euro-Truck-Simulator-2-Lane-Assist-Installer).

### Major Changes
- New installer
- Remade first time setup to reflect changes
	- This still requires a full remake, but it's *good enough* for now.
- Switched to bettercam in the place of dxcam.
	- Drop in replacement, but represents a performance improvement of up to 10ms.
- Added a [new wiki](https://wiki.ets2la.com/)
	- Still very much WIP.

### Bug Fixes
- As with every update, there have been a plethora of bug fixes.
	- Massive thanks to the people with crash reporting enabled, this has helped immensely in getting them fixed.

### Notes on new installation
It is recommended to download the .exe installer from sourceforge (the download button below). If you get an antivirus alert please send me a message, I've done my best in making it not flag, but so far there are still 2 no-name antiviruses that do flag it. (but most importantly microsoft doesn't)

You can see the report on [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6e4083c9eef613ec71faf240a0ff9df1fc4dd9ea268f8ee3dd04060f2abd1ad1?nocache=1).

However if you do want to use the installer manually then you can also download it from the [branch here](https://github.com/Tumppi066/Euro-Truck-Simulator-2-Lane-Assist/tree/installer). Keep in mind that this version might not work depending on your setup, since the new installer will now install all requirements automatically.
