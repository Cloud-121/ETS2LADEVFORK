This can be multiple things.
#### 1. Check that the SDK Controller plugin is enabled.
  1.1. In the app, click the "Plugins" button on the leftmost sidebar
  1.2. Make sure that the SDKController plugin looks like this:
  ![Enabled SDK Controller Plugin](/assets/WikiFAQ/SDKController.png)
  If it is grey, you should double click it to enable it.
#### 2. Check that the input files exist
  !!! Note
  If you already know where ETS2 is located on your drive, go ahead and skip to 2.4
  !!!
  2.1. Open up Steam and head over to your libray
  2.2. Find ETS2 in your library, then hit this button:

  2.4. In the file explorer window that opens, go through these folders:
  ```bin > win_x64 > plugins```
  2.5. In this directory, there should be 2 files:
    input_semantical.dll
    scs_telemetry.dll
  If these files are not there, or the plugins folder does not exist, you should run First Time Setup again.
